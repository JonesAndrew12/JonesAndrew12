\chapter{EXECUTIVE SUMMARY}
\pagenumbering{arabic}
\hspace{0.5cm} Buses are one of the most widely used public transport.It is mainly used by working people and students.The hot time for buses are morning and evening.We have heard many stories about late and missed busses.People have gone late to offices,missed classes,in many cases the total plan collapses due to one small thing.Bus timings are still a mystery in many villages and towns.One such area is Nemilichery which is a locality  located in Thiruvallur district.It has its own town panchayat and the people living here mostly work in IT.It has a railway station but still Bus transport is used more in this area.\\

\hspace{0.5cm} Many buses go to many places nearby like Avadi,Pattabiram,Thiruninravur and poonamalle.Since so many people are going in and out of town for work everyday,the office timings will be very crowded.Thus the project will greatly help the town.The proposed system involves equipping each bus with a GPS device and camera that continuously transmits its real-time data to a centralized server.The server processes this information and makes it accessible through various platforms, such as mobile applications and web interfaces.Passengers can easily access the tracking information like bus locations, estimated arrival times, and route updates,crowd tracking through their smartphones or other devices with internet.The proposed system can help solve most of the problems related to buses and their schedules.

\hspace{-0.5cm}\newline\textbf{Goals and Objectives:}\\
Passenger Convenience : The routes and the live tracking of the busses is available for the public to see which greatly increases and helps passengers making their life easier.\newline 
Safety and Security : As the bus is live tracked the passengers can rest assured as their location can be seen from anywhere in the world.During emergency situations like puncture,breakdown in dead zones the driver and other workers in the bus have all the options to report as an emergency and will be notified to the transport department for further decisions.\newline \\ \\
Data insights and analysis : By tracking the everyday crowd and analyzing the data,the project can manage the crowd better,add or stop the operation of extra busses.It can also customize by providing more busses on more crowded dates and less busses for less crowded dates.It can also
 analyze about the fuel being used,better routes for busses to save fuel and satisfy customers at the same time.\\ 
 \textbf{Intended Impact:}\\
 The project improves the overall travelling experience of the passengers by implementing real time location and crowd tracking of the bus.Everyone irrespective of where they are ,can access the website to see where the busses are.It can greatly reduce the waiting time of passengers,reduce the crowd per unit by adjusting the number of busses,live tracking the crowd so that passengers can plan beforehand on how to tackle the situation.It also ensures the safety of the passengers as the location is always available in the web.Emergency situations can also be handled quickly.The emergency feature also works in deadzones.The driver or the passengers have to report the issue in the app to activate the emergency mode.Overall it aims to improve the passenger's travel experience.\\
 \textbf{Beneficiaries:}\\
 The bus travelling passengers are the main first rate beneficiaries because they can locate busses,plan according to the crowd and help themselves in emergency situations.The organisation which is greatly benefited from this is the Transport department of all the states.After the routes and timings are well organised many people will prefer travelling by busses thus increasing the profits.The analysis can help in reducing the fuel costs.In a nutshell the overall profit increases.The environment is indirectly benefited as the fuel is reduced,so is the pollution.\\
\textbf{Social Issue:}\\
 The project clearly seeks to solve the bus timings and crowd problem which is being faced by the society everyday.The location of the bus is being shared hence solving the timing problem.The crowd is also tracked simultaneously so the people can see the seat logs thus solving the crowd problem also.After gathering data it can be analysed for making the experience even better and more comfortable than the previous version.Thus the underlying social problem can be solved by this project.
\chapter{OVERVIEW OF THE COMMUNITY}
\begin{justify}
\section{Introduction to village}
\item\text\quad Nemilicherry, a beautiful and culturally rich village located  close to Avadi in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, India, is a small region with diverse heritage and rapid development.Situated amidst the tranquil beauty of Tamil Nadu's landscapes, this village serves as a vibrant proof to the coexistence of tradition and modernity.
\\
\item\text With its origins dating back to centuries, Nemilicherry has witnessed a remarkable transformation over time. It has evolved into a growing community with a growing population that is reflective of the culture of Tamil Nadu. The village retains its traditional charm even when all the other cities surrounding it are in the modern era.
\\
\item\text Nemilicherry's strategic location near Avadi, a modern and well developed suburban hub of Chennai, brings both advantages and opportunities for its residents. Its proximity to Avadi's industrial areas and educational institutions has spurred economic growth and educational development in the region.
\\
\item\text In terms of culture and heritage, Nemilicherry boasts a richness of traditions, including religious festivals, dance, music, and culinary delights that reflect the vibrant Tamil culture. The warmth and hospitality of its residents add to the village's appeal, making it a welcoming place for both residents and visitors.Most of the people living here are cheerful working people who go in and out of town everyday.Since nemilichiery is still a developing village people prefer jobs in big cities like avadi and ambattur,Hence office timings are very much crowded.This village was selected for survey due to its bus travelling population and the common problems that the society faces everyday.The exacy locality of Nemichery has been given in Figure 2.1 .The most common buses from nemilichery have round trips to and from  Avadi,Poonamalle and Pattabiram.

\section{Project Activity Outcome}
\hspace{0.5cm}Developing a project focused on improving community transportation by locating bus routes can yield several valuable outcomes. Here are the project activity outcomes for such an initiative:\\ \\
\hspace{0.5cm} 
\textbf{Comprehensive Bus Route Map:} A comprehensive map of bus routes within the community, including detailed information about each route, such as stops, schedules, and transfer points can be created. This map can be made available in both digital and printed formats.\\ \\
\textbf{Mobile App for Route Information:} A mobile app that allows users to easily access real-time information about bus routes, including estimated arrival times, route changes, and service alerts can be created .The app is available for both Android and iOS platforms.\\ \\
\textbf{Integration with GPS Services:} Implement GPS tracking for buses, allowing users to track bus locations in real-time through the app. This feature would enhance the overall user experience and help commuters plan their journeys more effectively.\\ \\
\textbf{Safety Measures:} The safety of the passengers is ensured by live tracking the buses all the time.Moreover any emergency situations like breakdowns and punctures can easily be reported in the app.\\ \\
\textbf{Data Collection:} Gather data on existing bus routes, stops, schedules and crowd to Analyze crowd patterns,timings,better routes, and other relevant data to identify areas where route improvements are needed.Based on the analysis variable number of busses can be provided which reduces the cost of operation and increases the profits.\\ \\
\textbf{Environment changes:} By providing variable number of busses that is more busses if the crowd is more and less busses if the crowd is less we can save a lot of fuel and thus reduce the overall pollution caused to the environment.When busses become more reliable many people may convert to public transport from private transport which reduces the pollution even further down.

%PROJECT DESCRIPTION
\chapter{BACKGROUND & SURVEY ANALYSIS FOR PROBLEM STATEMENT}
\hspace{0.5cm} Community transportation is a critical component of urban and rural infrastructure, providing access to education, employment, healthcare, and essential services for residents. One of the key elements of an efficient community transportation system is a well-planned and organized bus route network. Locating and optimizing bus routes can significantly enhance the accessibility and convenience of public transportation, ultimately benefiting the community as a whole. This background study aims to highlight the importance of locating bus routes for better community transportation.
\section{Background Study}\\
P.C.Larra,E Cantelmi' who lived in The city of Springfield, with a population of 250,000, has been facing challenges with its public transportation system. Residents have reported long wait times, overcrowded buses, and inefficient routes. The city government has decided to conduct a comprehensive study to optimize bus routes and improve the overall community transportation experience. BRT is a high quality bus-based transit system that delivers fast,comfortable, and cost-effective urban mobility through the provision of segregated right infrastructure, rapid and frequent operations, and excellence in marketing and customer service. The United States Federal Transit Administration defines BRT as a “rapidmode of transportation that combines the quality of rail transit and the flexibility of buses.”[1]\\ 
\quad D.M.Maghanga tells that Effective bus routes can connect neighborhoods to key destinations such as schools, hospitals, employment centers, and shopping areas.Reduced Traffic Congestion,Well-planned routes can encourage commuters to choose public transportation over private vehicles, alleviating traffic congestion."Public transportation is often more cost-effective for both the community and individuals compared to owning and maintaining private vehicles".Fewer private vehicles on the road can lead to reduced greenhouse gas emissions and improved air quality.[2]\\ \\

\section{Society Relevant Problem Identification}
\\ \quad One of the main problems for bus passengers is uncertainty about when the next bus will arrive.Passengers might arrive at the bus stop without knowing if the bus is running on time or experiencing delays.Buses like any other vehicles, are susceptible to tire punctures or flat tires. This problem can cause delays in bus schedules, inconvenience for passengers, and traffic disruptions if the bus has to stop in the middle of the road for repairs.In remote areas sometimes busses may get broken down which will lead to further consequences as there may be no network.\\ \newline\hspace{0.5}
1.Maintenance and Reliability\\
2.Capacity Constraints\\
3.Traffic Congestion\\
4.Community Cohesion\\
5.Environmental Sustainability\\

Identifying these societal problems underscores the importance of locating and optimizing bus routes to create a more efficient, accessible, and sustainable community transportation system. Addressing these challenges can lead to improved mobility, reduced environmental impact, and enhanced overall well-being for residents.\\
