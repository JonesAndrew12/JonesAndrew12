\chapter{EXECUTIVE SUMMARY}
\pagenumbering{arabic}
\hspace{0.5cm} Buses are one of the most widely used public transport.It is mainly used by working people and students.The hot time for buses are morning and evening.We have heard many stories about late and missed busses.People have gone late to offices,missed classes,in many cases the total plan collapses due to one small thing.Bus timings are still a mystery in many villages and towns.One such area is Nemilichery which is a locality  located in Thiruvallur district.It has its own town panchayat and the people living here mostly work in IT.It has a railway station but still Bus transport is used more in this area.\\

\hspace{0.1cm} Many buses go to many places nearby like Avadi,Pattabiram,Thiruninravur and poonamalle.Since so many people are going in and out of town for work everyday,the office timings will be very crowded.Thus the project will greatly help the town.The proposed system involves equipping each bus with a GPS device and camera that continuously transmits its real-time data to a centralized server.The server processes this information and makes it accessible through various platforms, such as mobile applications and web interfaces.Passengers can easily access the tracking information like bus locations, estimated arrival times, and route updates,crowd tracking through their smartphones or other devices with internet.The proposed system can help solve most of the problems related to buses and their schedules.

\hspace{-0.5cm}\newline\textbf{Goals and Objectives:}\\
Passenger Convenience : The routes and the live tracking of the busses is available for the public to see which greatly increases and helps passengers making their life easier.\newline 
Safety and Security : As the bus is live tracked the passengers can rest assured as their location can be seen from anywhere in the world.During emergency situations like puncture,breakdown in dead zones the driver and other workers in the bus have all the options to report as an emergency and will be notified to the transport department for further decisions.\newline \\ \\
Data insights and analysis : By tracking the everyday crowd and analyzing the data,the project can manage the crowd better,add or stop the operation of extra busses.It can also customize by providing more busses on more crowded dates and less busses for less crowded dates.It can also
 analyze about the fuel being used,better routes for busses to save fuel and satisfy customers at the same time.\\
 \textbf{Intended Impact:}
 
 \hspace{0.5cm}The project improves the overall travelling experience of the passengers by implementing real time location and crowd tracking of the bus.Everyone irrespective of where they are ,can access the website to see where the busses are.It can greatly reduce the waiting time of passengers,reduce the crowd per unit by adjusting the number of busses,live tracking the crowd so that passengers can plan beforehand on how to tackle the situation.It also ensures the safety of the passengers as the location is always available in the web.Emergency situations can also be handled quickly.The emergency feature also works in deadzones.The driver or the passengers have to report the issue in the app to activate the emergency mode.Overall it aims to improve the passenger's travel experience.\\
 \textbf{Beneficiaries:}
 
\hspace{0.5cm}The bus travelling passengers are the main first rate beneficiaries because they can locate busses,plan according to the crowd and help themselves in emergency situations.The organisation which is greatly benefited from this is the Transport department of all the states.After the routes and timings are well organised many people will prefer travelling by busses thus increasing the profits.The analysis can help in reducing the fuel costs.In a nutshell the overall profit increases.The environment is indirectly benefited as the fuel is reduced,so is the pollution.\\
\textbf{Social Issue:}

\hspace{0.5cm}The project clearly seeks to solve the bus timings and crowd problem which is being faced by the society everyday.The location of the bus is being shared hence solving the timing problem.The crowd is also tracked simultaneously so the people can see the seat logs thus solving the crowd problem also.After gathering data it can be analysed for making the experience even better and more comfortable than the previous version.Thus the underlying social problem can be solved by this project.
\chapter{OVERVIEW OF THE COMMUNITY}
\begin{justify}
\section{Introduction to village}
\item\text\quad Nemilicherry, a beautiful and culturally rich village located  close to Avadi in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, India, is a small region with diverse heritage and rapid development.Situated amidst the tranquil beauty of Tamil Nadu's landscapes, this village serves as a vibrant proof to the coexistence of tradition and modernity.
\\
\item\text With its origins dating back to centuries, Nemilicherry has witnessed a remarkable transformation over time. It has evolved into a growing community with a growing population that is reflective of the culture of Tamil Nadu. The village retains its traditional charm even when all the other cities surrounding it are in the modern era.
\\
\item\text Nemilicherry's strategic location near Avadi, a modern and well developed suburban hub of Chennai, brings both advantages and opportunities for its residents. Its proximity to Avadi's industrial areas and educational institutions has spurred economic growth and educational development in the region.
\\
\item\text In terms of culture and heritage, Nemilicherry boasts a richness of traditions, including religious festivals, dance, music, and culinary delights that reflect the vibrant Tamil culture. The warmth and hospitality of its residents add to the village's appeal, making it a welcoming place for both residents and visitors.Most of the people living here are cheerful working people who go in and out of town everyday.Since nemilichiery is still a developing village people prefer jobs in big cities like avadi and ambattur,Hence office timings are very much crowded.This village was selected for survey due to its bus travelling population and the common problems that the society faces everyday.The exacy locality of Nemichery has been given in Figure 2.1 .The most common buses from nemilichery have round trips to and from  Avadi,Poonamalle and Pattabiram.

    \textbf{Detailed Report:}
\newline
\item\text\quad The Real-Time Bus Tracking Project aim is to enhance the overall travelling experience for passengers by providing them with up-to-the-minute information about bus locations and expected arrival times through a user-friendly mobile app and website. This technology-driven approach seeks to minimize the unpredictablity and inconvenience often associated with bus travel, thereby encouraging more individuals to rely on public transportation, reduce traffic jam, and promote environmental sustainability. It also modernize the operational aspects of the transportation system. By implementing GPS tracking system, we intend to permit transportation authorities with real-time insights into their bus stand. This includes tracking precise bus locations, monitoring adherence to schedules, and promptly addressing any route deviations or service disruptions. These capabilities can help transportation agencies optimize bus routes, allocate resources efficiently, and ultimately improve the reliability of the entire transportation system.The project is dedicated to making bus travel more convenient, efficient, and safe for all users. By achieving these objectives, our project contributes to the development of a modern and technologically advanced public transportation system, which not only caters to the needs of a growing urban population but also addresses the challenges of traffic jam and environmental sustainability, ultimately improving the quality of life for the community.

\section{Project Activity Outcome}
\hspace{0.5cm}Developing a project focused on improving community transportation by locating bus routes can yield several valuable outcomes. Here are the project activity outcomes for such an initiative:\\ \\
\hspace{0.5cm} 
\textbf{Comprehensive Bus Route Map:} A comprehensive map of bus routes within the community, including detailed information about each route, such as stops, schedules, and transfer points can be created. This map can be made available in both digital and printed formats.\\ \\
\textbf{Mobile App for Route Information:} A mobile app that allows users to easily access real-time information about bus routes, including estimated arrival times, route changes, and service alerts can be created .The app is available for both Android and iOS platforms.\\ \\
\textbf{Integration with GPS Services:} Implement GPS tracking for buses, allowing users to track bus locations in real-time through the app. This feature would enhance the overall user experience and help commuters plan their journeys more effectively.\\ \\
\textbf{Safety Measures:} The safety of the passengers is ensured by live tracking the buses all the time.Moreover any emergency situations like breakdowns and punctures can easily be reported in the app.\\ \\
\textbf{Data Collection:} Gather data on existing bus routes, stops, schedules and crowd to Analyze crowd patterns,timings,better routes, and other relevant data to identify areas where route improvements are needed.Based on the analysis variable number of busses can be provided which reduces the cost of operation and increases the profits.\\ \\
\textbf{Environment changes:} By providing variable number of busses that is more busses if the crowd is more and less busses if the crowd is less we can save a lot of fuel and thus reduce the overall pollution caused to the environment.When busses become more reliable many people may convert to public transport from private transport which reduces the pollution even further down.

%PROJECT DESCRIPTION
\chapter{BACKGROUND & SURVEY ANALYSIS FOR PROBLEM STATEMENT}
\hspace{0.5cm} Community transportation is a critical component of urban and rural infrastructure, providing access to education, employment, healthcare, and essential services for residents. One of the key elements of an efficient community transportation system is a well-planned and organized bus route network. Locating and optimizing bus routes can significantly enhance the accessibility and convenience of public transportation, ultimately benefiting the community as a whole. This background study aims to highlight the importance of locating bus routes for better community transportation.
\section{Background Study}

\hspace{0.5cm}P.C Darshan Ingle [2] et al proposed that Most of the peoples are traveling by the buses but some time it is take a too much time to reach the destination because the traffic, engines problems. To solve this issue the bus monitoring system using real-time GPS location is required. This bus monitoring system is providing the real-time locations and roots of travel. The use of mobile devices has become a part of our daily routine.  "The main focus of our work is on GPS. There is need of accurate estimation of Bus location.In this project, we proposed novel approach for location estimation called B-T-S (Bus Tracking System) based on adaptive location estimation method and GPS approach. We first designed novel GPS based location estimation method".\\

 \hspace{0.1cm}P.C D.M.Maghanga [1] et al presented that Effective bus routes can connect neighborhoods to key destinations such as schools, hospitals, employment centers, and shopping areas.Reduced Traffic Congestion,Well-planned routes can encourage commuters to choose public transportation over private vehicles, alleviating traffic congestion."Public transportation is often more cost-effective for both the community and individuals compared to owning and maintaining private vehicles".Fewer private vehicles on the road can lead to reduced greenhouse gas emissions and improved air quality.[2]\\ 
 
\hspace{0.1cm}P.C Larrain,E C [6] et al who has been facing challenges with its public transportation system. Residents have reported long wait times, overcrowded buses, and inefficient routes. The city government has decided to conduct a comprehensive study to optimize bus routes and improve the overall community transportation experience. BRT is a high quality bus-based transit system that delivers fast,comfortable, and cost-effective urban mobility through the provision of segregated right infrastructure, rapid and frequent operations, and excellence in marketing and customer service. The United States Federal Transit Administration defines BRT as a “rapidmode of transportation that combines the quality of rail transit and the flexibility of buses.”\\ \\
\section{Survey Analysis with report}

\quad The survey was conducted in nemilichery  bus stand on 18/7/2023.The pictures are attached in Figure 4.4,Figure 4.5,Figure 4.6 .Many questions were asked to the local bus users of nemilichery for analyzing the people's problems and choosing the perfect solution for the problem.The main problem was that the bus timing was not correct in almost all cases


\section{Society Relevant Problem Identification}
\\ \quad One of the main problems for bus passengers is uncertainty about when the next bus will arrive.Passengers might arrive at the bus stop without knowing if the bus is running on time or experiencing delays.Buses like any other vehicles, are susceptible to tire punctures or flat tires. This problem can cause delays in bus schedules, inconvenience for passengers, and traffic disruptions if the bus has to stop in the middle of the road for repairs.In remote areas sometimes busses may get broken down which will lead to further consequences as there may be no network.\\ \newline\hspace{0.5}
1.Maintenance and Reliability\\
2.Capacity Constraints\\
3.Traffic Congestion\\
4.Community Cohesion\\
5.Environmental Sustainability\\

Identifying these societal problems underscores the importance of locating and optimizing bus routes to create a more efficient, accessible, and sustainable community transportation system. Addressing these challenges can lead to improved mobility, reduced environmental impact, and enhanced overall well-being for residents.\\
 \section{Development of Problem solution}
 \textbf{Problem Identification and Understanding:} One of the main problems for bus passengers is uncertainty about when the next bus will arrive.Passengers might arrive at the bus stop without knowing if the bus is running on time or not.Elderly people and disabled people cannot travel without seats.They can check beforehand if seats are available or how is the present crowd in the bus and other features.Buses are susceptible to tire punctures or flat tires. This problem can cause delays in bus schedules, inconvenience for passengers, and traffic disruptions if the bus has to stop in the middle of the road for repairs.
\\ \newline
\textbf{Define Clear Objectives:} The goal of the project was to improve the travel experience of passengers by improving the real time tracking of location and seats.\newline \\
\textbf{Discussion with officials:} The ideas,insights and solution was thoroughly discussed with bus drivers,conducters and other members of transport department.Amongst the list of solutions the best solution was selected and decided to be worked upon.\newline \\
\textbf{Project Research:} The existing transport routes in and around nemilichery was identified and the busses were examined.All busses had a camera already built in but the GPS was older and  hence needed to be replaced with a latest version for better signal transmissions .\newline \\
\textbf{Solution Design:} An app was decided to be created in order to integrate all the data that is being gathered by the GPS and camera.The location to place the camera and GPS inside the busses was decided.\newline \\
\textbf{Real Time Tracking:} The ultimate solution is to track the busses in real time using a GPS and also to track the crowd by using a camera.The camera gives image as an input to the ML model which tracks the number of people and how crowded the bus is.The seat availability is tracked by the camera.\newline \\
\textbf{Environmental Sustainability:} By utilizing the data properly we can predict better routes and variable number of busses which can greatly cut the fuel costs and save the environment from pollution.Cutting down little pollution is also an improvement towards overall change.\newline\\
\textbf{Continuous Improvement:} From the data that is collected from the sensors we can analyze and predict better results like new routes and new features in the future for increasing the users comfort and experience.The app also has a feedback section to get the improvements and recommendations from the users.

\chapter{RECOMMENDATIONS AND
CONCLUSION}
\section{Recommendations }
\textbf{1.Expand the Bus Route Network:} Based on the analysis of the collected data we can predict better routes where people can utilize the bus service more.When new routes are added the bus route network is expanded creating more oppertunitites and chances for a better life for many people. \\ \\
\textbf{2.Environment changes:} Over a period of time after collecting data the fuel effeciency of the busses can be checked.The fuel economy can be greatly increased by rearranging the routes of the busses and by the method of variable number of busses.The more reliable the app becomes more people will shift to public transport and less the fuel consumption by private vehicles. \\ \\
\textbf{3.Integration with Other Services:} The tracking app can be integrated with other services such as police department for emergency cases.The data can also be useful to the forest department when busses travel inside forest areas.In case of emergency they can come to rescue quickly.Medical facilities,ambulances can also be provided rapidly as the location of the bus is always known.\\ \\
\textbf{4.Reliablility of people on software:} .The bus users can plan according to the location of the busses.They exaclty know when the bus will arrive and the approximate free seats.This greatly increases the reliability of the people with the app as well as with the busses.The more the reliability the more will be the population using busses everyday.\\ \\
\textbf{5.Education and Promotion:}The app can be promoted using social media and ads where all the majority of the users are students and employees.In build tutorials in the app can also help people identify the functions of the elements of the app. \\ \\
\textbf{6.Variable bus numbers:} It is also a feature that increases the eco-friendliness of the buses.More number of busses can be provided when the crowd is more and less number when the crowd is less.This is called variable number of busses.The crowd can be analyzed by collecting the data of the crowd over a period of time.The busses can be adjusting by the prediction of the crowd by an ML model.\\ \\
\section{Conclusion}
\hspace{11}
Real time tracking of the busses brings about many changes in the era of local bus users.The users can locate the busses from anywhere,know the approximate timings the busses arrive in stops,track the crowd and seat availability.\\

The GPS has to be fitted near the driver's seat and the camera is fitted behind the driver's seat.The GPS sends the location info all day even in night time.It has to be powered by the battery of the bus and has some emergency power to function in the case of emergency breakdown.The camera also functions by using the battery of the bus.The camera sends its data to the ML model which predicts the number of passengers on board and thus the crowd tracking.From the pictures we can also observe the empty seats which are displayed in the app.\\

The effect the project has is not only limited to the general users of the bus but also to the transportation department.As the busses become more reliable many people will shift to public busses because they are way cheaper and competitively fast than bikes or cars.The data obtained from the sensors is stored and used for further analysis on the behaviour of the crowd,fuel consumption of the bus,better routes that may be useful to the bus users.Variable number of buses will be provided.This will ensure minimal consumption of fuel over a period of time.Thus the project improves the livelihood of the society by improving the overall travel experience of the passengers using real time tracking of location and seat availability of the busses.\\
